# EmmVRCPatcher
Used to patch EMMVRC to allow for RiskyFuncs everywhere and a custom API server.

## Note for users
A pre-built version pointing to localhost, disconnecting you from EMMVRC's network but allowing all risky funcs, is available in the [releases](https://github.com/ERROR0418/EmmVRCPatcher/releases)

Other than that I will be keeping a list of public API servers (that people tell me about) at the bottom of this readme

## Note for developers
For testing the defaults are to pointed to localhost, feel free to grab the API server from [my other repo](https://github.com/ERROR0418/EmmServer).
You can host these if you want, feel free, Just leave a refrence to me/here somewhere, you don't have to but.. would be polite.
Also you will need EmmVRC.dll to build.. if you don't have this just give me a shout on discord and I'll `guide you`

## Known Servers
none :(
